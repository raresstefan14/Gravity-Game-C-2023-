# 🎮 Gravity Game (C# – 2023)

## 🧩 Overview
**Gravity Game** is a 2D physics-based desktop game developed in **C#** using **Windows Forms**.  
It simulates gravity, motion, and object collisions in real time. The project was created in 2023 as a personal learning exercise focused on **physics simulation**, **event-driven programming**, and **object-oriented design**.

The game’s visuals and some gameplay mechanics were inspired by tutorials from **Moo ICT**, which provided a great foundation for understanding game logic in WinForms.
